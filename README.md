## Executive Summary

This project simulates baseball games between the **Chicago White Sox** and **Chicago Cubs** based on **2023 real player statistics** using Monte Carlo simulation. Our goal was to model batter-pitcher matchups and estimate win probabilities through realistic statistical sampling. We conducted 1,000 simulated games and analyzed resulting distributions of scores and win rates.

---

## Problem Statement

Can we model and simulate the outcome of professional baseball games using historical player-level stats, and use that to predict head-to-head outcomes between two teams?

---

## Research Objectives

- Simulate MLB games using actual player batting/pitching stats  
- Model realistic outcomes (HR, strikeouts, BBs, etc.) using probabilistic matchups  
- Estimate win rates and scoring behavior over 1,000 simulated games  
- Explore statistical distributions and visualize simulation results  

---

## Dataset

We used the [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) package to extract the following datasets:

- **Team Schedule and Scores**  
- **Player Batting Stats** (`batting_stats(2023)`)  
- **Player Pitching Stats** (`pitching_stats(2023)`)

Teams used:  
- Chicago White Sox (`CHW`)  
- Chicago Cubs (`CHC`)  

> See [`prepared_data/DATA_DESCRIPTION.md`](prepared_data/DATA_DESCRIPTION.md) for data columns and download instructions.

## Features

We modeled each batter-pitcher matchup using the following features:

**Batter-Side**
- Batting Average (AVG)
- Home Run Rate (HR / AB)
- Walk Rate (BB / PA)
- Strikeout Rate (SO / PA)

**Pitcher-Side**
- Batting AVG allowed
- Walk Rate (BB / BF)
- Strikeout Rate (SO / BF)
- Hits allowed

---

## Methodology

- **Matchup Logic**: Each at-bat was simulated using weighted probabilities from batter and pitcher stats.  
- **Outcome Sampling**: We derived outcome likelihoods (`Hit`, `HR`, `BB`, `SO`, `Out`) and sampled accordingly.  
- **Inning Logic**: Standard 9-inning structure, 3 outs per half-inning.  
- **Extra Innings**: If tied after 9 innings, sudden death extra innings simulated.  
- **Simulation Count**: 1,000 games

- Cubs Win Rate: 50.4%  
- Tie Rate: 13.7%

## Limitations

- Sample size of batters/pitchers was small for demo purposes  
- No base-running, defense, or bullpen modeling  
- All matchups are treated independently (no fatigue, strategy, etc.)  
- Assumes stats are stationary over time

---

## Future Improvements

- Expand player pool to full roster  
- Add base-runner modeling and in-game strategy logic  
- Use time-dependent stats or rolling averages  
- Add team-specific fatigue and bullpen management logic

---

## How to Reproduce

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pybaseball pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
````

2. Run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook functional_code/codes.ipynb
```

All figures will be saved in the `results/` folder.

## AI Assistance

We used AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) to assist in the following areas:

- Debugging Python code and resolving logic issues
- Designing and refining the simulation structure
- Writing documentation and project management artifacts (e.g., Work Breakdown Structure, Status Log, Functional Specs)

All AI-assisted contributions were reviewed and validated by our team to ensure correctness and clarity.
